## Description

De novo assembly is widely used in biodiversity studies, but understanding all the steps and tools required for a good assembly can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this, we developed Colora, a Snakemake workflow that automates the process to aid scientists in producing complete, chromosome-scale de novo genome assemblies. Colora was primarily developed for plants, but it can be used for any organism and is designed to be user-friendly and versatile. With Colora, anyone can assemble a genome!

## Prerequisites

1. Familiarity with linux command line basics (cd, mv, rm)
2. Knowledge of the Nano editor will be helpful
